# Problem: Two Sum

**ID:** 1  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Topics:** Arrays, Hash Table

## Description
You are given an array of integers and an integer called `target`. Your task is to find the positions (indices) 
of two distinct elements in the array such that the sum of the values at those indices equals the target value. 
You can assume that there will always be exactly one valid pair of indices and that you cannot use the same 
element twice. The return order of the indices does not matter.

## Constraints
- 2 <= nums.length <= 10⁴
- -10⁹ <= nums[i] <= 10⁹
- -10⁹ <= target <= 10⁹

## Examples
Example:
- Input: nums = [4, 1, 9, 5], target = 13
- Output: [0, 2]
- Explanation: The elements at indices 0 (value 4) and 2 (value 9) sum to 13.
